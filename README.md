# JavaScript Basics: Conditional Statements

![Screenshot of the finished webpage](assets/images/complete.png)

## Description 📄

In this lab, you'll learn to use JavaScript's conditional statements to execute different parts of your code based on specific conditions. You'll start by understanding what conditional statements are, using the `if` statement to make decisions, and then expanding with the `else` statement for alternative outcomes. You'll also explore comparison operators, `truthy` and `falsy` values, data type checking, and logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`).

# Instructions ✅

## 1. **Create the Project Folder and File**

- [ ] Create a folder named `ConditionalStatementsBinary` to store your project files.
- [ ] Inside the `ConditionalStatementsBinary` folder, create a file named `index.js`. This file will contain all your JavaScript code.

## 2. **Create a Conditional Statement using `if`**

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is `true`. This allows your program to make decisions and run code only when certain conditions are met.

- [ ] In your `index.js` file, add the following code to create a simple example of an `if` conditional statement:

```js
// Using `if` to check a condition
let weather = 'rainy';

if (weather === 'rainy') {
  console.log("Take an umbrella!"); // Expected output: "Take an umbrella!"
}
```

- [ ] See your code in action: Run the JavaScript file in your terminal by entering the command `node index.js` and pressing Enter.

**Explanation:**

- The `if` statement checks whether the value of the variable `weather` is equal to `'rainy'`.
- If the condition `(weather === 'rainy')` is `true`, the code inside the curly braces `{}` is executed, which prints "Take an umbrella!" to the console.
- If the condition is `false` (for example, if the value of the variable `weather` is `'sunny'`), the code inside the `if` block will not run, and nothing will be printed.

## 3. **Expand Your Conditional with an `else` Statement**

The `else` statement can be added after an `if` statement to define an alternative block of code to execute when the `if` condition is `false`.

- [ ] In your `index.js` file, change the value of the `weather` variable to `"sunny"`. Do this by creating a new line that reassigns the variable, rather than modifying the original line where it is declared.
- [ ] Update your code to expand your example with an `else` statement:

```js
// Using `if` and `else` to handle different conditions


if (weather === 'rainy') {
  console.log("Take an umbrella!"); // Expected output: (This will not print because the condition is false)
} else {
  console.log("Enjoy the sunshine!"); // Expected output: "Enjoy the sunshine!"
}
```

- [ ] See your code in action: Run the JavaScript file in your terminal by entering the command `node index.js` and pressing Enter.
weather = 'sunny';
**Explanation:**

- The `else` statement runs a block of code if the `if` condition is false.
- In this example, if the value of the variable `weather` is `'rainy'`, the `if` block runs and prints "Take an umbrella!".
- If the value of the variable `weather` is anything other than `'rainy'`, the `else` block runs instead, printing "Enjoy the sunshine!".
- This shows how you can provide an alternative action if the original condition isn't met, allowing your program to handle multiple scenarios.

## 4. **Add Multiple `if` Statements and Understand the `else` Catch-All**
When using multiple `if` statements, JavaScript evaluates each `if` condition from top to bottom. As soon as it finds a condition that is `true`, it runs the corresponding code block and stops checking any remaining conditions.

- [ ] In your `index.js` file, update your code to expand your example with multiple `if` statements:

```js
// Using multiple `if` statements to handle different scenarios
weather = 'sunny';

if (weather === 'sunny') {
  console.log("Wear sunglasses!"); // Expected output: "Wear sunglasses!"
}

if (weather === 'rainy') {
  console.log("Take an umbrella!"); // Expected output: (This will not print because the condition is false)
}

if (weather === 'snowy') {
  console.log("Wear a coat!"); // Expected output: (This will not print because the condition is false)
}
```

- [ ] See your code in action: Run the JavaScript file in your terminal by entering the command `node index.js` and pressing Enter.

**Explanation:**

- The value of the `weather` variable to is set to`"sunny"`.
- JavaScript checks each `if` statement in order:
    - The first `if` checks if `weather === 'sunny'`. This is true, so it prints "Wear sunglasses!" to the console.
    - Because a true condition is found, JavaScript stops evaluating further `if` statements. Therefore, it does not check `if (weather === 'rainy')` or `if (weather === 'snowy')`.

## 5. **Learn and Use Comparison Operators**

Comparison operators are used in conditions to compare values. Common operators include:

- [ ] `==` (equal to)
- [ ] `===` (strictly equal to)
- [ ] `!=` (not equal to)
- [ ] `!==` (strictly not equal to)
- [ ] `>` (greater than)
- [ ] `<` (less than)
- [ ] `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- [ ] `<=` (less than or equal to)

- [ ] In your `index.js` file, add the following code examples to demonstrate how comparison operators work:

```js
// Comparison Operators
let age = 18;
let minimumDrivingAge = '18';

console.log(age == minimumDrivingAge);  // true (loose equality, checks value only)
console.log(age === minimumDrivingAge); // false (strict equality, checks value and type)

// Using typeof to check the data types
console.log(typeof age);           // "number"
console.log(typeof minimumDrivingAge); // "string"

// More comparisons
console.log(age != minimumDrivingAge);  // false (loose inequality, checks value only)
console.log(age !== minimumDrivingAge); // true (strict inequality, checks value and type)

// Additional examples with greater than and less than
let personAge = 20;
let requiredAge = 18;

console.log(personAge > requiredAge);  // true (20 is greater than 18)
console.log(personAge < requiredAge);  // false (20 is not less than 18)
console.log(personAge >= requiredAge); // true (20 is greater than or equal to 18)
console.log(personAge <= requiredAge); // false (20 is not less than or equal to 18)
```

- [ ] See your code in action: Run the JavaScript file in your terminal by entering the command `node index.js` and pressing Enter.

**Explanation:**

- `==` compares only the values, so `age == minDrivingAge` is `true` even though one is a number and the other is a string.
- `===` compares both the values and data types. Since `typeof age` is `"number"` and `typeof minDrivingAge` is `"string"`, `age === minDrivingAge` is `false` because they have different types.
- `!=` checks if the values are not equal (ignoring type), so `age != minDrivingAge` is `false` since both have the same value.
- `!==` checks if the values or types are not equal, so `age !== minDrivingAge` is `true` because the types differ (`number` vs. `string`).
- `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` are used for comparing numerical values to determine if one number is greater than, less than, or equal to another.

## 6. **Understanding Truthy and Falsy Values**

In JavaScript, certain values are treated as `true` or `false` when evaluated in a boolean context (like an `if` statement). These are known as "truthy" or "falsy" values. Examples of falsy values include `0`, `""` (empty string), `null`, `undefined`, `NaN` (not a number), and `false`. All other values are considered truthy.

- [ ] Add examples to `index.js` to explore truthy and falsy values:
- [ ] In your `index.js` file, add the following code examples to understand how truthy and falsy values work:

```js
// Truthy and Falsy Values Examples

age = 18;
minDrivingAge = '18';

// Comparison Operator with strict equality
if (age === minDrivingAge) {
  console.log("The ages are strictly equal."); // Expected output: (This will not print because the condition is false)
} else {
  console.log("The ages are not strictly equal."); // Expected output: "The ages are not strictly equal."
}

// Checking if a user input is truthy or falsy
let userInput;

if (userInput) {
  console.log("User input is truthy"); // Expected output: (This will not print because userInput is undefined and falsy)
} else {
  console.log("User input is falsy"); // Expected output: "User input is falsy"
}

// Assign a falsy value (0) and check its truthiness
userInput = 0;

if (userInput) {
  console.log("User input is truthy"); // Expected output: (This will not print because 0 is falsy)
} else {
  console.log("User input is falsy"); // Expected output: "User input is falsy"
}

// Assign a truthy value ('Hello') and check its truthiness
userInput = 'Hello';

if (userInput) {
  console.log("User input is truthy"); // Expected output: "User input is truthy"
} else {
  console.log("User input is falsy"); // Expected output: (This will not print because 'Hello' is truthy)
}
```
- [ ] See your code in action: Run the JavaScript file in your terminal by entering the command `node index.js` and pressing Enter.

**Explanation:**
- The `if (age === minDrivingAge)` example shows that when comparing two different types (`number` vs. `string`), the strict equality operator (`===`) evaluates as `false`.
- When `userInput` is initially `undefined` or `0`, which are both falsy values, the `else` block runs, and "User input is falsy" is printed.
- When `userInput` is assigned `'Hello'`, a non-empty string (truthy value), the `if` block runs, and "User input is truthy" is printed.


## 7. **Logical Operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)**

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions:

- [ ] `&&` (AND) - true if all conditions are true.
- [ ] `||` (OR) - true if at least one condition is true.
- [ ] `!` (NOT) - inverts the value of a condition.

- [ ] In your `index.js` file, add the following code examples to understand how logical operators work:

```js
// Logical Operators

age = 18;
minDrivingAge = '18';
let hasLicense = false;

// Using && (AND) operator to check if both conditions are true
if (age == minDrivingAge && hasLicense) {
  console.log("You can drive."); // Expected output: (This will not print because hasLicense is false)
} else {
  console.log("You cannot drive."); // Expected output: "You cannot drive."
}

// Using || (OR) operator to check if at least one condition is true
if (age >= 18 || hasLicense) {
  console.log("You meet one of the requirements to drive."); // Expected output: "You meet one of the requirements to drive."
} else {
  console.log("You do not meet the requirements to drive."); // Expected output: (This will not print because age >= 18 is true)
}

// Using ! (NOT) operator to invert a condition
let isWeekend = false;
if (!isWeekend) {
  console.log("It's a weekday."); // Expected output: "It's a weekday."
}
```

- [ ] See your code in action: Run the JavaScript file in your terminal by entering the command `node index.js` and pressing Enter.

**Explanation:**

- AND `(&&)` Operator: Combines two conditions. In `age == minDrivingAge && hasLicense`, both conditions need to be true for the code inside the `if` block to execute. Since `hasLicense` is `false`, the `else` block runs instead.
- OR (`||`) Operator: Checks if at least one of the conditions is true. In `age >= 18 || hasLicense`, since `age >= 18` is `true`, the code inside the `if` block runs even though `hasLicense`is `false`.
- NOT (`!`) Operator: Inverts the value of a condition. In `if (!isWeekend)`, the `!` operator flips `isWeekend` from `false` to `true`, so "It's a weekday." is printed.
